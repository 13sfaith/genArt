# Generative Art

## Welcome

Hello there, my name is Spencer Faith and this is my home for my Generative art pieces. I will be (attempting) to keep this updated.

## What frameworks are used

For all these pieces as of right now it is utilizing p5.js with some webGL sprinkled here and there. I am still working my away around to other frameworks, however, there will most certainly be more to come so stay tuned.

## How to utilize this repo

Each folder of the repo should consist of a different project that I have either finished or currently working on. Hopefully each project will have it's own corresponding README with details on the project and screenshots, along with a README I will try my very best to have crisp and clean documented code.

### note

I am still very much a newb to programming. I have done some programming for about 6 years of and off. I'm currently enrolled at ASU for a bachelors in computer science and am enjoying it very much. However, I am human and prone to mistakes if you see something and know of a better way or have any questions why I did what I did, please shoot me an email or message me on here. I would really enjoy connecting with people and hopefully become a little better in the process.

Cheers,
Spencer Faith
